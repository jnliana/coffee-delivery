## Project Overview

This React Coffee Shop project is a hands-on exercise aimed at practicing and enhancing my knowledge in React, with a specific focus on incorporating Storybook into the development workflow. The project simulates a virtual coffee shop where users can explore a menu, place orders, and customize their coffee preferences.

## Features

- **React Components:** The project utilizes React for building modular and reusable components, following best practices in React development.

- **Storybook Integration:** Storybook is integrated to facilitate the isolated development and documentation of React components. This provides a visual playground for each component, making it easier to iterate and test individual pieces of the application.

- **Coffee Menu Exploration:** Users can explore a variety of coffee options, each represented by a React component. Storybook allows for a seamless preview of these components in isolation.

- **Order Customization:** The project includes features for customizing coffee orders, such as selecting roast levels, choosing milk alternatives, and adding flavor options.
